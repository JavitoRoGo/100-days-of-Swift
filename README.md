# 100-days-of-Swift
Projects and milestones created following Paul Hudson's "100 Days of Swift"

These projects where made along several months, aprox. between April 2021 and November 2021.
By these days I didn't know how to use git nor GitHub, or even any version control, so any of these projects has no commits.

All of them where uploaded to this GitHub repository on April 2023.
